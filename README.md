# DSA_Class

The problem that was being solved in these projects is creating pseudocode and working code to accept a file, store it in a data scture of choice, and create functions that allow the user to search for a course, and print that information about it. It also allows the user to print a course list of every course.

The way that I approached the problem was thinking about which data structure was going to fit best for this project and I chose vector for that. It is important to understand what data sctuctures are and where they can be used. This is because differnt types of problems or applications require differnt types of data structures and the more knowledge that one has about these sctructures, the more that they can apply that knowledge to differnt problems or applications. 

The way that I overcame roadblocks was by taking mental breaks and then coming back to the problem but being persitant and not giving up. This is the way that I have been learning since I began my CS program. I think it is the best way for me to be able to digest things because it allows my brain time to rest and get ready to learn. Also, when I'm not working on a problem, i may think about it from time to time and be able to come up with a better solution because I have given my self enough time to properly think about the problem.

This project expanded my knowledge of data structures and algorithms. Before this classs, I was very knew to the DSA but throughout the course and these projects, I picked up a lot of knowledge that will allow me to use these data sctutures and algorithms in the futures. This is also more practice with coding, which allows me to work on making my code readable and easy to follow. This is something I've been working on since I started and with every coding project, it gets easier and easier.
